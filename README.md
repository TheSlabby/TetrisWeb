# Tetris for the Web
PHP web application that brings Tetris to the browser. The project uses the Twig template engine for server-side rendering, three.js for the client-side game, and SQLite for the leaderboard.

\
The client-side game was made with `three.js` (tetris_js directory)
\
And there's a leaderboard! (SQLite)
